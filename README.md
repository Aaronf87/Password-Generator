My JavaScript: Password Generator

Hi there!

My password Generator was made to function using JavaScript!  It accepts between 8 up to 128 characters with the combination of symbols, numbers, upper and lower case character.  

Its functionality has been tested to the MAX!

In the future I will be adding more conditons to generate only certain characters and not others.  Also want to add a copy button on the side for better usability for the user.

I hope to create more and likely style the app with some distinguishing fun characteristics.
